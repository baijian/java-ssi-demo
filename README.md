###spring 
Spring framework help people to wire different components together. It is useful in cases
where you have a lot of components and you might decide to combine them in different ways,
or wish to make it easy to swap out one component for another depending on different settings
or environments.

###struts
Struts2 is an action-based presentation framework.

###mybatis(ibatis)
iBATIS is a persistence framework which automates the mapping between SQL database and object,
in java the objects are POJOs(Plain Old Java Objects).The mappings are decoupled from the application
logic by packaging the SQL statements in XML configuration files.

Unlike ORM frameworks MyBatis does not map Java object to database tables but methods to SQL statements.
so mybatis lets you use all  your database functionality like stored procesures, views, queries of 
any complexity and vendor proprietary features.
